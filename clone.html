    <h3>(#section1) Section 1</h3>Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most abundant and widespread species of primate, characterized by bipedalism and large,
    complex brains. This has enabled the development of advanced tools, culture, and language. Humans are highly social and
    tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship
    networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social
    norms, and rituals, which bolster human society.</p>
