            &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who pionts out how 
            the strong man stumbles, or where the doesr of deeds could have done them bettwer. 
            The credit belongs to the man who is actually who strives
            veliantly ; how errs, who comes short again adn again,
            beacuse there is no effor without error adn shortcoming;
            but who enthusiasms, the great devetions; who spends himself in a worthy
            cause; who at the best knows the best knows  in the end the triump of high
            achievement, and who at the worst, if he fail, at least fails while 
            daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls 
            who neither know victory&nbsp;pnor&nbsp;defeat.&quot;
